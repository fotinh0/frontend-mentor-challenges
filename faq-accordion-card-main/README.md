## My process

I started by analyzing the layout of the preview design and planned out how to structure all of the contents in HTML. Then, I focused on the base styles such as the background colors, font colors, font-family, and font-sizes. From there, I worked from top to bottom adding styles ensuring each content displayed as close as possible to the final design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Media_objects) - This helped me with better undestanding the use of media queries.

- [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/css/) - This is a very useful documentation site which I used to review specific CSS syntax. Highly recommended!
