## My process
  
  I started by analyzing the layout of the preview design and planned out how to structure all of the contents in HTML using primarily ```<div>``` tags. Then, I focused on the base styles such as the background colors, font colors, font-family, and font-sizes. From there, I worked from top to bottom adding styles ensuring each content displayed as close as possible to the final design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I became more comfortable with styling HTML using CSS grid and flexbox layouts in order to create more responsive web pages. In addition, I gained a better understanding of content posititioning (``` position: relative; ``` and ```position: absolute```) and gaining deeper knowledge of when and how to use each type of positioning effectively.

### Continued development

I am still working on further developng my understanding and knowledge of media queries. In addition, I am further studying and undestanding the different unit sizes(rem, em, vh, etc.) and knowing how and when to use effectively. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Media_objects) - This helped me with better undestanding the use of media queries.

- [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/css/) - This is a very useful documentation site which I used to review specific CSS syntax. Highly recommended!
