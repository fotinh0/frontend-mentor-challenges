## My process

I started by analyzing the layout of the preview design and planned out how to structure all of the contents in HTML. Then, I focused on the base styles such as the background colors, font colors, font-family, and font-sizes. From there, I worked from top to bottom adding styles ensuring each content displayed as close as possible to the final design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I became more comfortable with styling HTML using CSS grid and flexbox layouts in order to create more responsive web pages. In addition, I gained a better understanding of content posititioning (position: relative; and position: absolute) and media queries. 

### Continued development

I am working on further developng my understanding and knowledge of media queries.
